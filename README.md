# QuizApp
I developed this Quiz Application with Vanilla JavaScript and used localstorage to store and fetch my datas.
Note: The CSS is not responsive so the design can come out funny on your screen, don't mind that. Future modifications can be made.
This QuizApp has an admin panel that can create, update, read and deleat questions plus students that took a quize test,
And the student panel only displays the questions answers and eventually the score after compleating the quize test.
